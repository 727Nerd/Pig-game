The game "pig" is an interesting game.
In the game, players take turns. During a turn, you are allowed to roll a dice as many times as you want - each roll counts towards your score.
However, if at any roll in the turn, you roll a 1 then your turn immediately ends and you lose all the points gained in the current turn.

The first person to 100 points wins.

Now in this game, there are 3 types of players:
 - Humans, whose decision to roll is inputted.
 - Non-spontaneous machine, who rolls the dice a fixed number of times each turn.
 - Spontaneous machine, who keeps rolling the dice until it reaches a certain number of points.
